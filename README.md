# cypress-io/github-action [![renovate-app badge][renovate-badge]][renovate-app] [![Action status](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/actions)

> [GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions) for running [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) end-to-end tests. Includes NPM installation, custom caching and lots of configuration options.

## Examples

### Basic

```yml
name: End-to-end tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      # Install NPM dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
```

### Browser

Specify the browser name or path with `browser` parameter

```yml
name: E2E on Chrome
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # let's make sure our tests pass on Chrome browser
    name: E2E on Chrome
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          browser: chrome
```

### Headless

Run the browser in headless mode

```yml
name: Chrome headless
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          browser: chrome
          headless: true
```

### Docker image

You can run tests in a GH Action in your Docker container.

```yml
name: E2E in custom container
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Cypress Docker image with Chrome v78
    # and Firefox v70 pre-installed
    container: cypress/browsers:node12.13.0-chrome78-ff70
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          browser: firefox
```

### Env

Specify the env argument with `env` parameter

```yml
name: Cypress tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Cypress run with env
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          env: host=api.dev.local,port=4222
```

### Specs

Specify the [spec files to run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run-spec-lt-spec-gt) with `spec` parameter

```yml
name: Cypress tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          spec: cypress/integration/spec1.js
```

For more information, visit [the Cypress command-line docs](https://on.cypress.io/command-line#cypress-run-env-lt-env-gt).

### Record test results on Cypress Dashboard

```yml
name: Cypress tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          record: true
        env:
          # pass the Dashboard record key as an environment variable
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

### Artifacts

If you don't record the test run on Cypress Dashboard, you can still store generated videos and screenshots as CI artifacts. See [cypress-gh-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-example) and the workflow example below

```yml
name: Artifacts
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Artifacts
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
      # after the test run completes
      # store videos and any screenshots
      # NOTE: screenshots will be generated only if E2E test failed
      # thus we store screenshots only on failures
      # Alternative: create and commit an empty cypress/screenshots folder
      # to always have something to upload
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        if: failure()
        with:
          name: cypress-screenshots
          path: cypress/screenshots
      # Test run video was always captured, so this action uses "always()" condition
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
        if: always()
        with:
          name: cypress-videos
          path: cypress/videos
```

### Config

Specify [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.html) values with `config` parameter

```yml
name: Cypress tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          config: pageLoadTimeout=100000,watchForFileChanges=false
```

### Config File

Specify the path to your config file with `config-file` parameter

```yml
name: Cypress tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          config-file: tests/cypress-config.json
```

### Parallel

You can spin multiple containers running in parallel using `strategy: matrix` argument. Just add more dummy items to the `containers: [1, 2, ...]` array to spin more free or paid containers. Then use `record` and `parallel` parameters to [load balance tests](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization)

```yml
name: Parallel Cypress Tests

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Cypress run
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        # run 3 copies of the current job in parallel
        containers: [1, 2, 3]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      # because of "record" and "parallel" parameters
      # these containers will load balance all found tests among themselves
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          record: true
          parallel: true
          group: 'Actions example'
        env:
          # pass the Dashboard record key as an environment variable
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

![Parallel run](images/parallel.png)

**Warning ⚠️:** Cypress Dashboard API connects parallel jobs into a single logical run using GitHub commit SHA plus workflow name, since there is no better unique ID during GitHub Action execution. Thus if you attempt to re-run GitHub checks, the Dashboard thinks the run has already ended. In order to truly rerun parallel jobs, push an empty commit with `git commit --allow-empty -m "re-run checks" && git push`. As another work around you can generate and cache a custom build id, read [Adding a unique build number to GitHub Actions](https://medium.com/attest-engineering/adding-a-unique-github-build-identifier-7aa2e83cadca)

### Build app

You can run a build step before starting tests

```yml
name: Build
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          build: npm run build
```

### Start server

If your tests run against a local server, use `start` parameter, the server will run in the background and will shut down after tests complete

```yml
name: With server
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          start: npm start
```

**Note:** sometimes on Windows you need to run a different start command. You can use `start-windows` parameter for this

```yml
name: With server
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          # Linux and MacOS
          start: npm start
          # Takes precedences on Windows
          start-windows: npm run start:windows:server
```

### Wait-on

If you are starting a local server and it takes a while to start, you can add a parameter `wait-on` and pass url to wait for the server to respond.

```yml
name: After server responds
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          start: npm start
          # quote the url to be safe against YML parsing surprises
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
```

By default, `wait-on` will retry for 60 seconds. You can pass a custom timeout in seconds using `wait-on-timeout`.

```yml
- uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
  with:
    start: npm start
    wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080/status'
    # wait for 2 minutes for the server to respond
    wait-on-timeout: 120
```

### Command prefix

You can prefix the test command using the `command-prefix` option. This is useful for example when running [Percy](https://docs.percy.io/docs/cypress), which requires the test command to be wrapped with `percy exec --`.

```yml
name: Taking Percy snapshots
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          start: npm start
          # quote the url to be safe against YML parsing surprises
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
          command-prefix: 'yarn run percy exec --'
```

### Custom build id

You can overwrite [`ci-build-id`](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization#Linking-CI-machines-for-parallelization-or-grouping) used to link separate machines running tests into a single parallel run.

```yml
name: Parallel
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        # run 3 copies of the current job in parallel
        containers: [1, 2, 3]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          record: true
          parallel: true
          group: 'Actions example'
          ci-build-id: '${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name }}'
        env:
          # pass the Dashboard record key as an environment variable
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

**Tip:** see GitHub Actions [environment variables](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables) and [expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).

### Working directory

In a monorepo, the end-to-end test might be placed in a different sub-folder from the application itself, like this

```text
repo/
  app/
  e2e/
    cypress
    cypress.json
  package.json
```

You can specify the `e2e` working directory when running Cypress tests using `working-directory` parameter

```yml
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          start: npm start
          working-directory: e2e
```

See [cypress-gh-action-monorepo](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-monorepo) for a running example

### Subfolders

Sometimes Cypress and end-to-end tests have their own `package.json` file in a subfolder, like

```text
root/
  e2e/
    (code for installing and running Cypress tests)
    package.json
    package-lock.json
    cypress.json
    cypress

  (code for running the "app" with "npm start")
  package.json
  yarn.lock
```

In that case you can combine this action with [bahmutov/npm-install](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install) action to install dependencies separately.

```yml
name: E2E
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Install root dependencies
        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1

      - name: Start server in the background
        run: npm start &

      # Cypress has its own package.json in folder "e2e"
      - name: Install Cypress and run tests
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          working-directory: e2e
```

See [cypress-gh-action-subfolders](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-subfolders) for example.

### Custom cache key

Sometimes the default cache key does not work. For example, if you cannot share the Node modules across Node versions due to native extensions. In that case pass your own `cache-key` parameter.

```yml
name: End-to-end tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # let's make sure our "app" works on several versions of Node
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [10, 12]
    name: E2E on Node v${{ matrix.node }}
    steps:
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      # run Cypress tests and record them under the same run
      # associated with commit SHA and just give a different group name
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          record: true
          group: Tests on Node v${{ matrix.node }}
          cache-key: node-v${{ matrix.node }}-on-${{ runner.os }}-hash-${{ hashFiles('yarn.lock') }}
        env:
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

### Split install and tests

Sometimes you may want to run additional commands between installation and tests. To enable this use the `install` and `runTests` parameters.

```yml
name: E2E
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Install dependencies
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          # just perform install
          runTests: false
      - run: yarn lint
      - name: Run e2e tests
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v1
        with:
          # we have already installed all dependencies above
          install: false
          # Cypress tests and config file are in "e2e" folder
          working-directory: e2e
```

See [cypress-gh-action-monorepo](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-monorepo) for working example.

## Notes

### Installation

This action installs local dependencies using lock files. If `yarn.lock` file is found, the install uses `yarn --frozen-lockfile` command. Otherwise it expects to find `package-lock.json` and install using `npm ci` command.

### Debugging

You can see verbose messages from GitHub Actions by setting the following secrets (from [Debugging Actions Guide](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-debugging.md#step-debug-logs))

```
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```
