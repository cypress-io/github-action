# example: yarn-modern-pnp

This example demonstrates installing dependencies using [Yarn Modern (version 2 and later)](https://yarnpkg.com/) with [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) turned on.

Cypress [12.9.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#12-9-0) is used, pending resolution of a compatibility issue between [Yarn Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) and the [Cypress desktop app](https://on.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app) using later versions of Cypress. See issue https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26567.
