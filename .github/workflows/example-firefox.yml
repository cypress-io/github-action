  # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cypress v9 and below (using Legacy configuration) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #

  # An example test using the Mozilla Firefox browser with Cypress v9 is no longer included here.
  #
  # Firefox connects unreliably with Cypress v9, as described in the closed Cypress issue
  # https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23215.
  # It is not planned to resolve the issue in Cypress v9.
  # The problem is however resolved in Cypress v10 and later.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cypress v10 and higher ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
