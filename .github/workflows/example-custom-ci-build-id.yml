# If this workflow is failing and you do not want to use it
# then you can disable it individually.
# See GitHub help: Disabling and enabling a workflow
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow).
#
# To set it up to work with your own Cypress Cloud refer to the README
# in the example directory examples/v10/recording.

#
# Typically you would let this action
# determine a unique build id to tie multiple parallel
# test jobs together into a single logical Cypress Cloud run.
# But sometimes you need to execute Cypress using
# your own custom command and pass your --ci-build-id
# In that case it is important to make sure this build id
# is generated _again_ on workflow re-run. This example
# shows how to create a unique ID then pass it to
# multiple testing jobs running in parallel
# based on the recipe written in
# https://medium.com/attest-r-and-d/adding-a-unique-github-build-identifier-7aa2e83cadca
# The use of set-output is however deprecated by GitHub since the above blog was written
# in 2019 so this is replaced by GitHub Environment files, see
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#environment-files
