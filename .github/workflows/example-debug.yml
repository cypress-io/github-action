# This workflow demonstrates how to use the DEBUG environment variable to get debug output.
# See also https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/blob/master/README.md#debugging and
# https://on.cypress.io/troubleshooting#Print-DEBUG-logs

# In the example jobs, the action is called with
# uses: ./
# which runs the action code from the current branch.
# If you copy this workflow to another repo, replace the above line with
# uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
