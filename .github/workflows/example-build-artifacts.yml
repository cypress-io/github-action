# This workflow shows how to split build and test steps with artifacts.
# In the build job, dependencies are installed, the app is built and the build results
# are stored as an artifact using actions/upload-artifact.
# No tests are run in the build job.
# The test jobs use the results from the build job:
# - dependencies and the Cypress binary are installed using dependency caching
# - build results are restored using actions/download-artifact
