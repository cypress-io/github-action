# Typically you would let this action
# determine the unique build it to tie multiple parallel
# test jobs together into a single logical Dashboard run.
# But sometimes you need to execute Cypress using
# your own custom command and pass your --ci-build-id
# In that case it is important to make sure this build id
# is generated _again_ on workflow re-run. This example
# shows how to do create a unique ID then pass it to
# multiple testing jobs running in parallel
# based on the recipe written in
# https://medium.com/attest-r-and-d/adding-a-unique-github-build-identifier-7aa2e83cadca
