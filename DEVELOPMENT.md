# Development

## Testing via examples

1. Add a new example project in `examples` folder. It is a regular NPM package with its own `package.json` and Cypress dev dependency.
1. Add a corresponding `.github/workflows` YAML file that uses this action and runs inside `examples/X` working directory. The example should demonstrate the feature
1. Add workflow badge to README if needed

## Testing against another repo

1. Create a new local branch for any development, for example `git checkout -b featureA`
1. Update the source code in [index.js](index.js)
1. Build `dist` file(s) using `npm run build`
1. Commit any changed files, note the SHA of the commit
1. Push the local branch to GitHub
1. In a test repository, create a test branch, change the action to point at the new commit. Example

```yml
name: End-to-end tests
on: push
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: 22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # use specific commit pushed to GitHub
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@<full commit SHA>
```

You can use [cypress-gh-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-example) or [cypress-gh-action-monorepo](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-monorepo) as test projects.

7. Push the change and make sure the new feature performs correctly. If yes, open a pull request.

**For pull request reviewers:**

1. When merging a pull request, squash all commits into one.
1. Make sure the commit subject and body follow [semantic commit convention](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format). For instance, keeping it simple:

```text
feat: added new parameter
fix: fixed a bug
```

If you need to bump the major version, mark it as breaking change in the body of the commit's message like:

```text
fix: upgrade dependency X

BREAKING CHANGE: requires minimum Node.js 14 to run
```

3. New versions of this action will be released automatically by the CI, see [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml). This will create a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/releases) and will update the current `/v5` branch. Thus specifying `- uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5` selects the new version automatically.

## Updating the latest version in GitHub Marketplace

Seems to be a manual process right now. After a new release has been created, go to the release and click "Edit"

Review the release info, make sure the "publish ..." checkbox is checked

After clicking "Update the release" check that the Marketplace [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cypress-io) has been updated.
